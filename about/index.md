The name of this blog reflects my interest in the cytoskeleton, which literally translates to "the cell's skeleton." However I will not restrict my ramblings to only the cytoskeleton. This blog will be a dumping ground for anything I happen to be thinking about. My latest interests include small molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions, endoplasmic reticulum localization signals, website development, and science communication.

With respect to website development, I have used  [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for several projects. I like Drupal for all the usual reasons: it is powerful, there is a vibrant community, and it is free (as in free beer). My latest project is found at [Undergradinthelab.com](http://undergradinthelab.com). I also built an electronic lab notebook that our lab has been using for years. I also have (quite) limited experience with [WordPress](https://wordpress.com). For this blog, I wanted to learn something new, so I explored using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I liked the speed of Jekyll sites and I found a bunch of attractive free themes on [http://jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org), so I decide to build this site using Jekyll. It is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) with [GitHub-Pages](https://pages.github.com).
